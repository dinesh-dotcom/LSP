POSIX Threads.
-------------
On most recent Linux distributions the standard Makefile should compile these rpograms sucessfully. 
The alternative, makefile-explicit, is provided for any systems that need the include and thread library paths explicity defining.

thread1.c  -  a simple program using threads.

thread2.c  -  a program that executes 2 threads simultaneously.  You may have to wait a few seconds before
this program produces output.

thread3.c  -  a program that synchronizes threads using seamphores.
